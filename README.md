# computercraft
This is a collection of programs - applications and APIs, that I use with ComputerCraft or CC:Tweaked and modded Minecraft.

## How to install
This collection comes with an in-game installer/package manager, so that you easily can install, update and uninstall programs from within ComputerCraft.
Start a CC computer, then run the command 
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kirayatail/computercraft/master/installer.lua
``` 
to download the installer directly from here.
After that, just run the installer program on the CC computer and choose the programs you like from there.

## Further information
You can find detailed descriptions on each program in the [Wiki](https://github.com/kirayatail/computercraft/wiki)

code that runs inside the ComputerCraft/CC:Tweaked mod, and any effects on other mods or Minecraft as such it may have, is well beyond the scope.
